    one litre of milk costs 0.89â‚¬
    if you buy three pieces of milk they get discounted 10%

    What is the price of 7 litres of milk?

    two variables:
    - singles
    - batches

    constraints:
    singles * 1 + batches * 3 = 7

    minimize:
    singles * 0.89 + batches * 3 * 0.89 * 0.9

    Can you dynamically build ILP problem

    # Pricing rule 1:
    # if total is greater than 50â‚¬, delivery is free

    # Pricing rule 2:
    # if you buy three items from selection A (which contains multiple products), each gets 5% discount

    # Pricing rule 3:
    # if product has manual discount (for example old model), you get it 30% off

    # Assume basket contains items that do match to above rules and then "normal" items.
    # Can you assign variables with algorithm?

    # Variable choosing algorithm

    # Rule 1
    # variables don't know the total sum, maybe calculate this after ILP

    # Rule 2
    # 1. Find items belonging to selections, similar to batch discount example
    #    each item has non discounted variable and one belonging to discount.
    #
    #    What if you have 4 items that can be included in the discount, but some are more expensive
    #    maybe sort by price such that highest price items are more likely used in discount instead
    #    of leaving as singles. ðŸ¤”

    # Rule 3
    # Split products to "two", one with discount and one without
